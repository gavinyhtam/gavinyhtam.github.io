1st Person
I'm a passionate and motivated 2nd year B.Commerce student, majoring in Finance. 
I will serve as the Vice President (Internal) in 2016, coordinating the internal affairs of the society. 
Over the summer, I've completed an internship at Rothschild, a Global Financial Advisory firm, which has helped me gain a broader understanding of the mechanics of  finance in the modern world, as well as developing my attention to detail and resourcefulness.
I am fueled by curiosity and spontaneity, which particularly draws me towards backpacking, and ultimately expands my ability to see alternatives and to work effectively in a dynamic environment.
